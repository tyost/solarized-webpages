# TODO

* Add options page on about:blank#solarized-config
* Deal with shadows.
* Process bright images.
* Deal with text entry elements.
* Identify elements that are specially distinguished
  and use alternate base backgrounds where appropriate
  (e.g. bordered elements, special backgrounds).
* Elements that fail a color contrast test against
  their backgrounds should be adjusted.
  Images may need recolored.
* Setting to compensate for changes in screen color
  temperature (e.g. f.lux).
